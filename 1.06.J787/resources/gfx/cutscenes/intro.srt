1
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.000
Isaac, and his Mother lived alone
in a small house on a hill.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
Isaac kept to himself

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.400
drawing pictures
and playing with his toys

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.300
..as his mom watched Christian
broadcasts on the television.

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.300
Life was simple,
and they were both happy.

6
00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:31.700
That was, until the day Isaac's
mom heard a voice from above.

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.800
"Your son has become corrupted by sin!
He needs to be saved."

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.900
"I will do my best to save him, my lord",
Isaac's mother replied

9
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.200
rushing into Isaac's room, removing
all that was evil from his life.

10
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.700
Again, the voice called to her.

11
00:00:53:500 --> 00:00:56.000
"Isaac's soul is still corrupt.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.800
"He needs to be cut off from
all that is evil in this world

13
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.100
and confess his sins."

14
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.100
"I will follow your instructions, lord.
I have faith in thee."

15
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.700
Isaac's mother replied

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.600
as she locked Isaac in his room,
away from the evils of the world.

17
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.200
One last time, Isaac's mom heard
the voice of god calling to her.

18
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.500
"You've done as I've asked.

19
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
"But I still question
your devotion to me.

20
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
To prove your faith, I will ask
one more thing of you."

21
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
"Yes Lord, anything!",
Isaac's mother begged.

22
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.900
"To prove your love and devotion,
I require a sacrifice.

23
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.700
Your son Isaac will be
this sacrifice."

24
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.800
"Go into his room and end his life,

25
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.000
as an offering to me to prove
you love me above all else."

26
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.700
"Yes, Lord.", she replied

27
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.200
grabbing a butcher's knife
from the kitchen.

28
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.000
Isaac, watching through a crack
in his door, trembled in fear.

29
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.450
Scrambling around his room
to find a hiding place

30
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.400
he noticed a trap door to the
basement, hidden under his rug.

31
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.800
Without hesitation,
he flung open the hatch

32
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.200
just as his mother
burst through his door

33
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.650
and threw himself down,
into the unknown depths below.
