1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Isaac was cornered.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.650
His mother, fueled with the desire to serve her God

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.000
was bearing down on Isaac.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.350
"I will do as I'm told, my Lord. I love you above all else"

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.000
Isaac's mother repeated to herself.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.500
This was the end of the line for Isaac.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
His mother was far too strong for him, 

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.750
but, just as he accepted his fate

9
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.700
God intervened

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.500
sending an angel down from above to stop his mother's hand.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500
And, just like that, it was over.
