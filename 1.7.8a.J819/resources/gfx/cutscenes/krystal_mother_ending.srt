00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.800
Isaac... what are you drawing?

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.600
Isaac, let me see it.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.500
Give it to me now.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.100
This is what you think of me?

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
This is what I am to you? A monster?

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500
No, no, Mom, it's just--

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.100
After all I've done for you, this is how you view me?

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.200
You think I'm a monster, Isaac? I'll show you a monster!

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.600
No, Mom, no! Please!

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.700
You are just like your father. I can't even look at you.

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.500
How could you? You're just like him!

12
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.900
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

13
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.300
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.

14
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.600
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses

15
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.000
as we forgive those who trespass against us..
