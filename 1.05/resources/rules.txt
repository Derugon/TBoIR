rooms may yield more
than you expect
experimentation is key

some doors
require a blessing
carry them with you

the walls will harden
over time
time is the essence

sleeping gatekeepers
will need to be awoken
with a loud sound

a piece of paper
is your guide

deny his gifts
to attain your reward

a dark market
lies under your feet

chub dislikes smoke!
