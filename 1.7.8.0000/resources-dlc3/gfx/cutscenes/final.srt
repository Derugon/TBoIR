1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Then, suddenly, the sky above cracked open

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.500
and a white beam of light reached down into the Earth

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.300
smiting the Mother of Harlots asunder

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.000
and setting the blood lake to a boil.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.400
As the Beast descended down into the lake of fire

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.400
Isaac ascended towards the crack in the sky

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.600
and as he flew he could see echoes of his past before him.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.500
He saw his mother mourning the loss of her son.

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.800
He saw his father leaving them without turning to say goodbye.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.900
He saw his mother sleeping, and his father taking money from her purse.

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.400
He heard the late-night fights they had that kept him up at night

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.000
and the guilt he felt for what he believed he was causing.

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.400
He felt the pain in his stomach during those sleepless nights

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800
and saw his shadow in the closet, waiting for him.

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.200
As he rose, he felt his fears drop from his body.

16
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.200
His shame, his worry, pulled from his being.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.500
As he became lighter, his ascent became faster.

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.100
He saw his one true companion, alive and well.

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.800
He saw his mother and father together again, holding each other.

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.100
He felt his mother kissing him on the head after he had said his prayers

21
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.500
and the comfort of knowing someone was watching over him.

22
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.300
He saw his own birth

23
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.100
and the faces of his parents filled with joy and optimism.

24
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.100
And then... he saw nothing.

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.500
Are you sure this is how you want this story to end, Isaac?

26
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.300
You're the one writing it, it doesn't have to end this way.

27
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.800
Here, how about we tell it a different way?

28
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.800
Maybe a happy ending?

29
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Okay, Daddy.

30
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.600
Good. Are you getting sleepy yet?

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.400
Yeah.

32
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.300
Okay, so... *Ahem*

33
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.500
Isaac and his parents lived in a small house, on the top of a hill...
